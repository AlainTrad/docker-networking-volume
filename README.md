# Docker Networking and Volume Management

## Purpose

This project demonstrates Docker container orchestration, focusing on networking and volume management. It includes two containers:

- **Data Producer**: Generates data (random strings we can see in the python scripts).
- **Data Consumer**: Receives data and stores it using Docker volumes.

---

## Components

1. **Dockerfiles**: 
   - Define the environment for the **Data Producer** and **Data Consumer** containers.
   
2. **docker-compose.yml**: 
   - Configures the services, sets up networking, and manages volumes.

---

## How to Build and Run

1. **Build the Docker images**:
   ```
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. **Start the containers**:
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```

The Data Producer generates data, and the Data Consumer stores it persistently.
